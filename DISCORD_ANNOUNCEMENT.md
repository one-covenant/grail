🚀 NEW RELEASE IS OUT!

⚠️ Miners: Pull the latest code and restart your processes to pick up this release.

The big change: we removed the per-miner rollouts cap by default. Previously, miners who exceeded the unique rollouts ceiling had excess work burned with no reward. Now rewards scale proportionally to your output. Produce more, earn more.

On the trainer side, trust list propagation is now ~6 minutes (down from ~2.5 hours) via R2, with on-chain fallback if R2 is unavailable. Validator incentive logic is unchanged.

Enjoy!
